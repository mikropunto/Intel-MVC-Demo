Intel-MVC-Demo
==============

My first GitHub project. It's just intended to be a demo of the Intel App Framwework so it's purpose is achieveing:

-  a MVC app behavior 
-  a SEO-Friendly Deep Linking URL structure     (Ex: localhost/hello  & localhost/hello/world)
-  integrate Handlebars templates
-  set the proper Storage Adapters
-  implemente the UI
-  include the native plugins (i18n, etc)
-  adapt jQuery plugins 

So I'll be able to choose between Angular or Intel App Fw for my real projects...

Thanks for watching ;)
